	<h1>Teaching and learning vocabulary</h1>
	<h2>
		The key to learning vocabulary is repetition of useful words with
		variety and attention
	</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Repetition</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Learning typically requires multiple repetitions, and it is best if
		those repetitions are spread out in time.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Useful words</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		The previous topic is all about what words are useful. In general,
		those are the most common 2,000 words plus another 1,000 or so which
		might focus on one genre, such as
		<a
			href="https://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Academic_word_list"
			target="_blank"
		>
			academic vocabulary
		</a>
		.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Variety</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Students need to see the word and hear the word. It's great if they can
		connect an image to the word. If the word has different forms, it's
		useful if they are encountered. Seeing the word in and out of context
		in various sentences or definitions is also helpful.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Attention</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		It is not merely enough to encounter the word while your mind is
		somewhere else. The more attention and engagement you can bring to the
		word, the better.
	</p>

		<h2>The barriers to learning vocabulary</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Barriers to repetition</strong>
	</p>
	<ol type="1" start="1">
		<li>
			The main barrier to repetition is simply motivation. It is
			completely reasonable and understandable that people do not enjoy
			drilling themselves on flashcards or reading lots and lots of
			books. There's probably some goal that you have that you're not
			making progress towards. I know I have many things I'd like to
			learn, but I lack the motivation.
		</li>
		<li>
			Time is another major barrier. This one's pretty obvious. It's
			important, however, to view your students as people with lives.
			Many of them have jobs and families that demand a lot of their
			time, leaving them little time to study. In many cases, they have
			not "chosen" to learn English in the way one chooses to complete a
			TESL certificate, so we have to be
			<a

				target="_blank"
			>
				respectful
			</a>of their decisions about how to use their time.
		</li>
		<li>
			Every encounter with a low-frequency vocabulary item eats up the
			time and motivation that could have gone into learning something
			useful. We can't avoid them all, but we can limit them and
			discourage our students from studying them.
		</li>
		<li>
			Making sure you get a lot of repetitions of the words you're
			studying requires a certain amount of organization. Software, such
			as
			<a href="https://linguatorium.com/portal/my/main" target="_blank">
				Linguatorium</a>, helps to relieve that organizational barrier.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<strong>Barriers to useful vocabulary</strong>
	</p>
	<ol type="1" start="5">
		<li>
			Most people agree that frequent vocabulary is more important than
			infrequent vocabulary, but many people have bad intuitions about
			what vocabulary is common, usually dramatically overestimating the
			frequency of words and phrases. Sometimes, this is because the
			words are seen as children's vocabulary (e.g., zoo animals) and
			sometimes it's just because they're quite familiar to expert users
			of English (e.g., gambling idioms like <em>hit the jackpot</em>).
			If you think about it, though, <em>giraffe</em> doesn't appear very
			often in conversation, movies, news, or novels. And
			<a
				href="https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/?c=coca&q=110754933"
				target="_blank"
			>
				<em>hit the jackpot</em></a> 
				is actually quite rare. If you don't believe that people
			overestimate these things, check out
			<a
				href="https://english-jack.blogspot.com/2007/07/idioms.html"
				target="_blank"
			>
				this blog post</a>
				I wrote in 2007.
		</li>
		<li>
			Some people believe that they need to "learn the hard words" in
			order to improve their vocabulary. This is not entirely wrong, but
			learning the "hard words" before learning the "easy words" is a bad
			investment of time and money.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<strong>Barriers to variety</strong>
	</p>
	<ol type="1" start="7">
		<li>
			Drilling with flashcards is a very efficient way to learn a basic
			meaning of a word. <strong>I strongly encourage it</strong>, but
			flashcards all by themselves do not provide variety.
		</li>
		<li>
			Most teachers and learner are focused on accuracy instead of
			fluency. This means that they tend to limit themselves to very
			short texts. As a result, students are unlikely to see the
			vocabulary they are learning in various contexts. This can be
			overcome by making sure that students also spend a lot of time on
			fluency-building activities like
			<a
				href="https://erfoundation.org/wordpress/what_is/"
				target="_blank"
			>
				extensive reading</a>. If students read one
			<a
				href="https://erfoundation.org/wordpress/graded-readers/"
				target="_blank"
			>
				graded reader</a>
				at their level each week, they will dramatically increase the
			variety of vocabulary encounters without reducing the number of
			repetitions or including a lot of low-frequency vocabulary.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<strong>Barriers to attention</strong>
	</p>
	<ol type="1" start="9">
		<li>
			I think we're all familiar with barriers to attention, so I won't
			say much here.
		</li>
		<li>
			Some students believe that repetition, on its own, is enough. They
			waste time, writing out the same word a hundred times. Meanwhile,
			after the fifth or sixth time, their mind has drifted to questions
			about what's in the fridge or how many likes their recent Instagram
			post has.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Deliberate practice</h2>
	<p>
		<a
			href="https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice"
			target="_blank"
		>
			Deliberate practice</a> (DelP) is the key to learning almost anything. The reason I
		specifically bring it up in our discussion vocabulary learning is that
	</p>
	<ul type="disc">
	</ul>
	<ol type="1" start="1">
		<li>
			DelP only works for skills that other people have already figured
			out how to do.
			<br/>
			(There are good English-X bilingual dictionaries for many
			languages.)
		</li>
		<li>
			It involves well-defined, specific goals. Once a goal is met, a new
			goal is set. (Vocabulary learning is easy to quantify)
		</li>
		<li>
			It requires regular, accurate feedback. (This is fairly easy to do
			with vocabulary)
		</li>
		<li>
			It requires effective mental representations. (Often possible in
			vocabulary)
		</li>
		<li>
			It usually involves building on or modifying previously acquired
			skills. (A key feature of vocabulary)
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		As you can see, DelP is a good fit for learning vocabulary, while it's
		not as easy with grammar and pronunciation, which are often much
		fuzzier, harder to get feedback on, harder to explain and understand,
		and hard to make and check goals about.
	</p>
	<p>
		DelP has two other features, which are important, but not particularly
		suited to vocabulary learning.
	</p>
	<ul type="disc">
	</ul>
	<ol type="1" start="6">
		<li>
			It requires you to constantly push beyond what's comfortable and
			familiar. "It demands near-maximal effort, which is generally not
			enjoyable."
		</li>
		<li>
			It requires your full attention. You must notice problems and
			correct them.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Xr-e9zisTk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	</p>
	<p>
		DelP differs from naive practice and purposeful practice.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Naive practice</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is what most people do when they practice. It's not bad to get
		from zero to something, but it will only get you so far. Here are
		<a
			href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/deliberate-practice"
			target="_blank"
		>
			some examples</a>
		of naive practice.
	</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<ul type="circle">
			<li>
				Playing tennis, chess, scrabble, or any other competitive game
				casually with a friend
			</li>
			<li>
				Writing the same type of articles you normally write
			</li>
			<li>
				Playing music you already know how to play
			</li>
			<li>
				Practicing a song, but continuing on when you miss notes
			</li>
			<li>
				Looking up a recipe, baking a pie, and then keeping making that
				kind of pie in the future
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<strong>Purposeful practice</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is much better than naive practice, and sometimes, it's the best
		you can do, but it's generally not as effective as DelP. The main
		difference from naive practice is that people who are practicing
		purposefully have a SMART goal.
	</p>
	<p>
		The main difference between purposeful practice and deliberate practice
		is in the immediate, specific feedback.
	</p>
	<h2>Explaining the meaning of words</h2>
	<p>
		Meaning is dealt with in the branch of linguistics (and of philosophy)
		called semantics. Explaining the meaning of words, specifically, as
		dictionaries do, is dealt with in lexicography. (The authority of "The
		Dictionary" is
		<a
			href="standards.html"
			target="_blank"
		>
			covered in module three</a>.)
	</p>
	<p>
		The first part of this video is a good, basic introduction to the
		meaning of words. The rest of it is interesting but not especially
		relevant to ELT.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice the idea of categories, which
		<a
			href="categories.html"
			target="_blank"
		>
			we looked at in the first module</a>
		comes up again here. Finding and explaining meaningful categories is
		central to language and to language teaching.
	</p>
	<p>
		The easiest and most efficient way to explain the meaning of a word is
		to <strong>translate it</strong>. Many language teachers are prejudiced
		against the use of the first language. It is certainly possible to go
		overboard in using the L1, and you may have been in classes that
		predominantly use the L1 to teach an L2. But the use of the L1 is well
		justified on both empirical and philosophical grounds. It is
		vanishingly rare for an L1 translation to ever a perfectly capture the
		meaning of a word, but that problem applies to any method for conveying
		meaning. Translation is especially useful for low-frequency items that
		would otherwise take up too much class time to deal with.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you don't translate, you should
	</p>
	<ul type="circle">
		<li>
			Use brief, clear definitions, focusing on the core meaning or
			the prototypical cases
		</li>
		<li>
			It may be easier for lower level students if you explain the meaning of words instead of paraphrasing.
		</li>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>
				<strong>Explanation</strong>: If something is <strong>probably</strong> true, or will
				<strong>probably</strong> happen, it means there is a high
				<a
					href="https://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/chance"
					title="chance"
				>
					chance</a>
				of it.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Paraphrase</strong>: having a high chance of being true
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			Use what you can: objects, pictures, gesture, etc
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Nobody is naturally good at explaining the meaning of words, but that's
		a lot of what language teachers do, and if you want to be a good
		language teacher, it's useful for you to be able to describe the
		meaning of words. This requires deliberate practice (see above). If you
		expect your students to do deliberate practice (and you should), then
		you should also be willing to engage in deliberate practice. The best
		way to do this is to
	</p>
	<ul type="disc">
	</ul>
	<ol type="1" start="1">
		<li>
			choose a high-frequency or AWL word
		</li>
		<li>
			try to explain it
		</li>
		<li>
check a good dictionary such as the			<a href="https://www.ldoceonline.com/" target="_blank">LDOCE</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			revise your explanation
		</li>
		<li>
			repeat 10 times
		</li>
		<li>
			wait until the next day and repeat
		</li>
		<li>
			stop after you rarely need to revise, likely requiring hundreds of
			repetitions
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		I did my deliberate practice on the <em>Simple English Wiktionary</em>,
		where you can see thousands of
		<a
			href="https://simple.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Brett&amp;dir=prev&amp;target=Brett"
			target="_blank"
		>
			my definitions</a>
		and examples.
	</p>
	<h2>Vocabulary learning techniques</h2>
	<p>
		I'm not going to try to be systematic about vocabulary learning
		techniques. Rather, I'll focus on those that I think are most
		effective:
	</p>
	<ol type="1" start="1">
		<li>
			Self testing with spaced repetition ("flashcard drill")
		</li>
		<li>
			The keyword technique
		</li>
		<li>
			Guessing from context
		</li>
		<li>
			Classroom activities
		</li>
		<li>
			Extensive reading
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Self testing with spaced repetition ("flashcard drill")</h3>
	<p>
		This is by far the most efficient way to learn a form-meaning pairing.
		In fact, a very recent meta analysis shows that the average person can
		learn a word a minute using this technique, and that's on a delayed
		post-test (Webb, Yanagisawa, &amp; Uchihara, 2020).
	</p>
	<p>
		BUT...
	</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>
			The best way to lose weight is eat less and exercise more.
		</li>
		<li>
			The best way to quit smoking is to stop putting cigarettes in
			your mouth.
		</li>
		<li>
			The best way to become a great golfer is to put in thousands of
			hours of practice.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		There are people for whom these work, but most people lack the
		motivation and self-control.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, this is by far the most efficient way to learn <strong>a form-meaning pairing</strong>. It is less effective for
		learning other aspects of vocabulary (e.g., register &amp;
		collocations).
	</p>
	<p>
		Usually this involves some kind of paper or computerized flashcards.

		Much better is to use a simple sentence that exemplifies the word well,
		along with its translation.

		You can also add the lexical category or other information, and, if the
		word has multiple forms, then it might be useful to add them to your
		word card, as in the following case:
	</p>
	<div align="center">
		<table cellpadding="0" border="1">

				<tr>
					<td>
						<p align="center">

					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<p align="center">
							Je suis trop <u>occup&#233;</u> pour aller au

		<strong>Steps</strong>
	</p>
	<ol type="1" start="1">
		<li>
			Put the L1 on one side of a word card and the L2 on the other side.
			(Or do the equivalent in some software).

			<br/>
			(At 15 new words per day, in a year you can learn &gt; 5,000
			form-meaning pairings.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Sort your cards so that the new vocabulary appears first and the
			review vocabulary comes later.
		</li>
		<li>
			Decide if you're studying for production or reception. (We'll
			assume production.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Start studying.Continue until you've reached your goal.

	</ol>
	<ol>
		<ol type="1" start="1">

	<h3>The keyword technique</h3>
	<p>
		This technique has excellent results when it is used. Unfortunately, it
		is challenging to execute, and so it is not often used.

	<h3>Guessing from context</h3>
	<p>
		Teachers should

	<ul>
		<li>
			provide learners with material in which they know &gt;98% of the
			vocabulary.
		</li>
		<li>
			provide practice material, replacing target words with non-words

			<li>
				e.g.,
				<em>
					provide practice <u>woftary</u>, replacing target words
					with non-words
				</em>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			Require learners to justify their guesses.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Learners should
	</p>
	<ol type="1" start="1">
		<li>

			<li>
				If it's a verb, find any subject or complements

	<h3>Classroom activities</h3>
	<p>
		Classroom activities should (Yousefi &amp; Biria, 2018) encourage
	</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>
			attention &amp; noticing
		</li>
		<li>
			recycling/repetition
		</li>
		<li>
			retrieval from memory (not just recognition)
		</li>
		<li>
			generation
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		and should make use of the fact that students are together in the
		classroom. In other words, gathering a bunch of people together in a
		room and then getting them to work individually on what is a very
		social skill - language - is a wasted opportunity.
	</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>
			Cloze review/summary (in pairs)
		</li>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>
				After a reading or listening activity, present the students
				with a summary of the text with the target vocabulary
				gapped out. (As a rule of thumb, no more than 12 gaps,
				roughly)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			Retelling/summary
		</li>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>
				Have students retell a story they read or summarize a video
				they watched. This is most interesting if the partner has
				not seen it.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			Dictation
		</li>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>
				There are
				<a

					lots of great ways to do dictation</a>. Just make sure that whatever you're dictating uses the
				target vocabulary.

		</ul>
		<li>
			Delayed copying (in pairs)
		</li>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>
				Both partners look at a sentence. B keeps the text, while A
				tries to write it down from memory as B watches. B gives
				feedback. A corrects themself, and then they switch roles.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			Peer teaching with flashcard exchange
		</li>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>
				Create about 12 different flashcards (use multiple copies
				if you have more students), and hand them out. A meets B
				and asks "do you know what this word means?" showing B the
				word. A and B then negotiate the meaning of the word. A
				might eventually ask for an example sentence. After B take
				a turn, then they exchange flashcards, find a new partner,
				and repeat.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			Matching (in pairs)
		</li>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>
				On a printed sheet, there's a list of words and a list of
				definitions/translations/examples. Match them up.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			Vocabulary discussion
		</li>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>
				Prepare a set of about 5 questions focused on the target
				vocabulary. For example, if your target word is something
				like <em>interfere</em>, then you might prepare a question
				like "What interferes with your learning English?"
			</li>
			<li>
				Put students in a small group of 3 or 4, and ask them to
				discuss their answers to the questions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Ask one to count the number of times the target vocabulary
				is used.
			</li>
			<li>
				Tell them to move to the next question when it has been
				used about 6 times.

		</ul>
		<li>
			Progressive deletion (in pairs)
		</li>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>
				Start with a (short) paragraph, printed on a sheet of

				with a few target words missing. Below that, reproduce it
				with a few more words missing. Keep doing that until there
				are three or four versions.
			</li>
			<li>
				The pair read the original together.
			</li>
			<li>
				B keeps the original, while A looks at the version with a
				few words missing.
			</li>
			<li>
				A read their paragraph to B, saying the missing words if

			<li>
				If A can't remember, B offers hints.

		<li>
			Shadowing (works better at home)
		</li>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>
				Make or find a recording of a text with the target words.
				Also, produce a transcript.
			</li>
			<li>
				The students should individually listen to the original
				while reading aloud from the transcript.
			</li>
			<li>
				Their goal is to match their delivery to the recording.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			Read-aloud stories with vocabulary explanations (teacher-led)
		</li>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>
				Choose a graded reader and read a chapter a day to the

			</li>
			<li>
				Students can stop you at any time to ask about the meaning
				of a word.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<h3>Extensive reading</h3>
	<p>
		Extensive Reading usually means reading a lot of self-selected, easy,
		interesting texts and doing few or no exercises afterwards.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Read a lot
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Many programs set 1 million words per year as a goal.
			</li>
			<li>
				Many coursebooks, in contast, have less than 10,000 words of
				input per level.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			Let students select their own books.
		</li>
		<li>
			They should be EASY.
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				To accomplish this, the language needs to be mostly familiar to
				learners.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a graded reader, they should know all but one or two words
				in a two-page spread.
			</li>
			<li>
				When they read it, they should see the story in their head (not
				the words on the page).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			The books should be interesting. If a student finds they've started
			a book they don't like, they should stop and choose a new one.
		</li>
		<li>
			Students often do lots of exercises and very little reading.
			Instead of adding more exercises, just let them read.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Reading requires automatic recognition of words. Learners become able
		to do this only through massive amounts of practice. By reading
		extensively, learners encounter vocabulary (and grammar) repeatedly and
		in varying contexts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Extensive reading is a good complement to word cards which mainly help
		form-meaning pairs. Successful individual reading experiences promote
		learner autonomy which leads to "learning success and enhanced
		motivation".
	</p>
	<p>
		Studies show that by reading a lot of interesting texts, foreign
		language learners learn a little new vocabulary and learn more about
		old vocabulary. They improve their attitude toward reading and language
		learning. They improve their writing ability and read more fluently
		(Jeon &amp; Day, 2016; Liu &amp; Zhang, 2018; Nakanishi, 2015).
	</p>
	<p>
		Some minor difficulties are that teachers can feel they have no role.
		Administrators may similarly wonder what a teacher is doing. To
		overcome this, the teacher can conference with individual learners
		while the others are reading. Also, it may be difficult to develop or
		access a library of readers, though there are paid online options, such
		as

		It seems obvious that you would teach related words together. This is
		useful in some ways but actually can cause problems in certain cases.
	</p>
	<p>
		Imagine you're learning a language called Verdic, and your Verdic
		teacher introduces the following three words:
	</p>
	<ul type="disc">
	</ul>
	<ol type="1" start="1">
		<li>
			<em>Vord</em>
			<em> </em>
			"mandarin orange"
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Verd</em>
			"clementine orange"
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Vird</em>
			"navel orange"
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		When you come back the next day, your teacher asks you if you remember
		the topic of yesterday's lesson. Of course, you do, it was about citrus
		fruits. "Great," your Verdic teacher says. "Do you remember which
		fruits we studied?" Again, you do: mandarine, clementine, and navel
		oranges. "Wonderful," your teacher exclaims. "So, how do you say navel
		orange in Verdic?"
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course, all you can remember is that it starts with <em>v </em>and
		ends with <em>rd</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Studying a semantic set like this makes it very easy to recall the list
		of things for which you learned words, but the words get all mixed up.
		And, of course, when the words themselves are similar, it becomes even
		harder.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many textbooks and language teachers introduce new vocabulary in groups
		like this: things you find in the kitchen, the months of the year, free
		time activities, colours, etc. This is counter-productive. It makes it
		easier for students to remember the topic, but harder for them to
		remember which word applies to which case.
	</p>
	<p>
		You also tend to see new vocabulary listed alphabetically. Thus, you
get lists like		<em> comment, commit, committee, common, community, company</em>. This
		is how an evil genius would teach English. Don't be an evil genius.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the other hand, it can be fine to group words by word families. In
other words, when you introduce <em>bake</em>, you could also introduce		<em>baker</em>, and maybe even <em>bakery</em>. These are unlikely to
		be confused, and they mean that <em>bake </em>gets more repetition and
		variety.
	</p>
	<p>
		In general, it's best to focus on words that are not closely
		semantically related (kinds of orange, days of the week), but it's fine
		to have some general topical similarity. For example, you could have
going out for coffee as your theme, and you could include words like		<em>table, friend, chat, pay, </em>and <em>spill</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Above all, make sure that your vocabulary is USEFUL, and that it is
		grouped by frequency, for example: first 500 words, 501-1,000;
		1,000-2,000 and AWL. These frequency bands can be quite broad and they
		can be flexible around the edges. It would be pointless to avoid
		putting word #450 together with #540 because they're in different
		bands. But you should wonder about the wisdom of putting #45 together
		with #1,450.
	</p>
	<p>
		In short, group thematically and frequentially (new vocabulary). Feel
		free to teach word families instead of individual lexemes, but avoid
		words that are otherwise similar in terms of meaning, spelling, or
		pronunciation.

	<h2>The vocabulary lesson plan</h2>
	<p>
		Vocabulary should be an element in most lesson plans, but I see no role
		for a "vocabulary lesson". Consequently, I see no role for a vocabulary
		lesson plan. The question, then is how to fit vocabulary into a general
		lesson plan.
	</p>
	<h3>Preteaching</h3>
	<p>
		Some vocabulary should be addressed before a lesson. Target vocabulary
		can be dealt with in an activity such as matching or peer teaching with
		with flashcard exchange. Topic-essential low-frequency words can be
		provided in a list with a gloss, but very little time should be spent
		focusing on or "teaching" these items.
	</p>
	<h3>During the lesson</h3>
	<p>
		Target vocabulary can be identified in any printed materials through
		typographical features such as bold, underline, or colour. Glosses or
		translations can be provided nearby in the text or on a separate page.
		Before a first listening, the teacher could ask students to count the
		number of times a particular word (or two) appears. During a listening
		activity, the teacher can pause before the occurrence of a target word
		and ask student to guess which one might appear. Alternatively the
		teacher can pause after an occurrence and review the meaning and
		pronunciation.
	</p>
	<h3>After the main part of the lesson</h3>
	<p>
		Review is crucial. Activities like dictogloss or cloze summary can be
		used to focus both on the core lesson goals and on target vocabulary at
		the same time. Students can be given homework on sites like
		<a href="https://linguatorium.com/portal/my/main" target="_blank">
			Linguatorium.
		</a>
