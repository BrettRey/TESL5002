        to the extinction of thousands of languages around the world, the
        teaching of English has historically been part of the colonialist
        program. This is not to deny that, in the world today, teaching English
        as a second language can provide students with instrumental and social
        benefits. But it is important that English-language teachers keep in
        mind the harms that have been caused in the past and the current power 
        of the language and those who present themselves as its
        owners, stewards, and propagators.
