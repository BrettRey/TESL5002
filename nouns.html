			 <p>There is no perfect definition of <i>noun</i>, just as there is no perfect definition of <i>soup</i>, but we can get very close, as long as we are willing to hedge with words like <i>can</i>, <i>almost</i>, and <i>typically</i>. Examples follow below.</p>
			 <p>I will use words here that have not yet been defined. This may be frustrating, but it is inevitable. Syntax is a system, and its elements can only be defined in relation to each other. The meaning of the other words will become clear soon.</p>
			 <ul>
				 <li>Nouns can denote almost anything from objects to actions to characteristics.</li>
				 <li>A word that denotes a person, place, or thing is a noun (but not "a noun is a word that denotes person, place, or thing").</li>
				 <li>A word that is countable is a noun (but not "all nouns are countable").</li>
				 <li>Almost any word that is plural is a noun (but not "all nouns can be plural").</li>
				 <li>Nouns can typically follow <i>the</i> or <i>a</i> (but not "words following <i>the</i> or <i>a</i> are nouns").</li>
				 <li>Nouns can typically be modified by adjective phrases (but not "words modified by adjective phrases are nouns").</li>
				 <li>Nouns cannot typically be modified by adverb phrases.</li>
				 <li>Nouns head noun phrases.</li>
				 <li>Noun phrases can perform a variety of functions, including subject and object (but not “subjects and objects are noun phrases”).</li>
				 <li>Noun phrases can typically be possessive (but not “possessives are noun phrases”).</li>
			 </ul>
			 <p>Importantly, each of these characteristics can be unclear to English-language learners. It's also important to note that many of the statements are not commutative (multiplication is commutative but division isn't; X &times; Y &equals; Y &times; X but X &divide; Y &ne; Y &divide; X).</p>
			 <h3>Some examples</h3>

				 <p>What examples can you find of nouns that do NOT have one or more of the properties listed?</p>

		 <p>If you have any questions, make a note of them. Add them to the discussion board or bring them up with a classmate. You can also send an email to <a href="mailto:brett.reynolds@humber.ca">Brett</a> or bring it up in class on Tuesday.</p>
