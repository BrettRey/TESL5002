		<h1>Verbs and verb phrases</h1>

			<p>So, what can we say about English verbs? Here's a list of nice verby verbs, really typical ones:</p>
			<ul>
    			<li><i>jump, walk, ask, turn, work, move, play, pull, reach, laugh</i></li>
    		</ul>

			<p>Are they action words? They sure are. Did you notice that this could be a list of nouns though?</p>
			<ul>
    			<li>she missed the <b>jump</b></li>
    			<li>I went for a <b>walk</b></li>
    			<li>that's a pretty big <b>ask</b></li>
    			<li>give it a <b>turn</b> and see</li>
    			<li>I went to <b>work</b></li>
    			<li>etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each of the underlined words above is a noun. If you don't believe me, try thinking about the characteristics we studied earlier. But in the following cases, they're verbs.</p>
			<ul>
    			<li>she <b>jumped</b>< the gap</li>
    			<li>I <b>walk</b> the dog each morning</li>
    			<li>he's <b>asking</b> for a $10,000 raise</li>
    			<li>it's hard to <b>turn</b> the knob</li>
    			<li>I <b>work</b> in Toronto</li>
			</ul>
    
			<p>So, how can we tell the difference between nouns and verbs? Sometimes we can't until they're in context. The list above is perfectly ambiguous. Nevertheless, verbs generally have the following properties (again, example follow):</p>
			<ul>
				 <li>Verbs typically denote actions and states, and they do not denote physical objects.</li>
				 <li>A word that has a past-tense form is a verb (but not all verbs have past-tense forms).</li>
				 <li>Almost every verb has an -s form (but not all).</li>
				 <li>Almost every verb has an -ing form (but not all).</li>
				 <li>Almost every verb can follow the infinitive marker to.</li>
				 <li>A verb cannot be modified by an adjective phrase (never ever... I think).</li>
				 <li>A verb can typically be modified by an adverb phrase.</li>
				 <li>A verb phrase must be headed by a verb (always).</li>
				 <li>A clause must be headed by a verb phrase (always).</li>
				 <li>A verb is often in an agreement relationship with a phrase functioning as the subject of the clause.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Again, let's look at some examples.</p>

			<p>What examples can you find of verbs that don't have one or more of the properties listed?</p>
			<p>Again, these explanations use words that have not yet been defined. I understand that it may be frustrating, but it is inevitable. Syntax is a system, and its elements can only be defined in relation to each other. The meaning of the other words will become clear soon. When you meet them, you should cycle back and have another look at this material.</p>
