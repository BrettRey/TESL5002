	<h1>Some terminological issues</h1>
	<p style="padding-left:30px;">You will often see expressions like "adverbial", "adverb phrase", or "adverb clause" used when there isn't a single adverb to be found. This is based on an entirely semantic idea of what it means to be "adverbial". Specifically, if something answers the questions "when", "where", "why", or "how", then people often use the term adverbial.
	<p style="padding-left:30px;">They're not wrong.
	<p style="padding-left:30px;">Terminology is arbitrary. There's no inherently correct term. We could use a different term for what we're calling <small>DETERMINERS</small>. We could call them <small>SPECIFIERS</small> instead. Or we could call them <small>ARTICLES</small> or <small>MARKERS</small> or <small>SPOONS</small> or <small>CATEGORY 6</small>. In principle, any label should do.
	<p style="padding-left:30px;">We could even call them <small>STEVE</small>.

	<p style="padding-left:30px;">BUT.
	<p style="padding-left:30px;">While the label does not matter, the category does. And a category of things that "answer the question 'when', 'where', 'why', or 'how'", based entirely on semantics, is not a useful syntactic category. By this definition, <i>my birthday</i> is "adverbial". So is <i>Toronto</i>, <i>reasons</i>, and <i>with binoculars</i>. But these things just don't go together. They don't make a coherent set, and you can't teach anybody anything useful about grammar by lumping them together.
	<p style="padding-left:30px;">Terms are just labels, and any label will work. But categories matter. They tell us about the world. And trying to make sense of badly constructed categories just makes life harder for everyone.
