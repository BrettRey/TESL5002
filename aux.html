		<h1>Auxiliary verbs</h1>
		
		<p>There is a small sub-category of verbs called the auxiliary verbs. They have the NICER properties.
		<ul>
			N&nbsp; &nbsp;Negation with <i>not</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Lee will not eat apples.&nbsp; &nbsp;*Kim eats not apples.</i>
			<br>I&nbsp; &nbsp; Inversion in questions&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Lee has eaten apples → Has Lee eaten apples?&nbsp; &nbsp;*Eats Lee apples?</i>
			<br>C&nbsp; &nbsp;Contracted negative form&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>didn’t, shouldn’t&nbsp; &nbsp;*eatn’t, *keptn’t</i>
			<br>E&nbsp; &nbsp;Ellipsis&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Kim was eating, and Lee was ___, too.&nbsp; &nbsp;*Kim kept eating, and Lee kept ___, too.</i>
			<br>R&nbsp; &nbsp;Rebuttal&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>I did tóo/só read it. (did not!)&nbsp; &nbsp;*I tried tóo/só to read it.</i> (<i>*tried not!</i>)
		</ul>
		<p>These include the modal auxiliaries:
		<ul>
			<i>will&nbsp; &nbsp;won't&nbsp; &nbsp;would&nbsp; &nbsp;wouldn't</i>
			<br><i>shall&nbsp; &nbsp;shan't&nbsp; &nbsp;should&nbsp; &nbsp;shouldn't</i>
			<br><i>may&nbsp; &nbsp;--&nbsp; &nbsp;might&nbsp; &nbsp;mightn't</i>
			<br><i>can&nbsp; &nbsp;can't&nbsp; &nbsp;could&nbsp; &nbsp;couldn't</i>
			<br><i>must&nbsp; &nbsp;mustn't&nbsp; &nbsp;--&nbsp; &nbsp;--</i>
		</ul>
		<p>And a few others
		<ul><i>be</i> (for passive and progressive), <i>do</i> (for questions), and <i>have</i> (for perfect)
			<br><i>need, dare</i> (not for North American English)
		</ul>
