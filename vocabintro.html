		<h1>Analyzing, explaining, and teaching vocabulary</h1>
<p>From the learner's point of view, vocabulary is, perhaps, the aspect of English that is most tractable. We seem to be able to learn vocabulary our whole lives, and learning vocabulary in a second language doesn't seem to pose the same difficulties that grammar and pronunciation do. If you put in the time and effort, you can learn a lot of vocabulary.
<p>The tricky aspect as are really from the teaching point of view. Because there are so many words, teachers need to choose well. This requires a good understanding of what a word is, what it's made up of, and its frequency. It also requires an understanding of the elements of practice that lead to learning.
