    <h1>Standards </h1>
</p>
<p>
    Let's start with the word, <em>standard</em>.
</p>
<p>
    For most people, <em>standard</em> has positive connotations. Consider the
words that we use together with <em>standard</em>: From    <a href="https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/" target="_blank">COCA</a>,
we get collocations such as <em>gold standard </em>and    <em> quality standard. </em>There are standards of living and standards of
    care. If you have high standards or exceed them, that's a good thing. We
    have educational standards, environmental standards, and technology
    standards, which are supposed to make our education, environment, and
    technology better.
</p>
<p>
As a result, when we see <em>Standard English</em> (note the capital    <em>S</em>), it would not be surprising if that evoked positive
    associations. You would be excused for thinking that Standard English is
    "good" English. You may have the idea that Standard English is basically
    grammatical English, or formal, or literary English. It is none of those
    things.
</p>
<p>
    You're certainly old enough to know what a VHS is. What you my be too young
    to know, though, is what Betamax is. Back in the early 1980s, they were
    <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape_format_war"
        target="_blank"
    >
        competing video tape standards
    </a>
    . By most criteria, Betamax was a higher quality product. It had a better
    picture and better sound. Nevertheless, it died so long ago that you may
    never have heard of it, and VHS became the standard for video cassette tape
    and players. Standard doesn't mean good, it just means standard.

    Standard rail gauge is 1,435 mm wide. Toronto gauge is 1,495 mm wide. Each
    size has benefits and drawbacks, but the main benefit of standard rail
    gauge is that it is standard. It is the most commonly used, and so if you
    want new rail cars, it's much easier to get them if you use a standard
    gauge.
</p>
<p>
    In fact, standards are one of the things that
    <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/standards-2/" target="_blank">
        underpin our modern world
    </a>
    . In many cases, however, another standard would be just as good, A4 paper
    is neither better nor worse than US Letter, but in most of the world it is
    better because it is the standard, and in North America, US Letter is
    better because it is the standard.
</p>
<p>
    That's <strong>almost</strong> how you should think about Standard English.
Any other English could be the standard    <strong>if it were standard</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    But there are two important differences between technology standards and
    language standards. First, a technology standard is predefined. Somebody
    planned it out. Language isn't like that. If you don't follow a technology
    standard, your technology probably won't work. A TTC streetcar, for
    instance, simply will not run on standard gauge rails. It's useless as a
    means of transportation. Similarly, a VHS cassette simply will not play on
    a Betamax player.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast, much of the time – perhaps most of the time – non-standard
    English works perfectly well. There are dialects and varieties that you or
    I cannot understand – or cannot understand easily – but there are so many
    more that we can. If communication is the main function of language, then,
    why do we have Standard English?
</p>
<p>
    The answer is that another function of language is to regulate group
    membership. In other words, language helps us to identify
    people who are like us, who belong to our group.
</p>
<p>
    Consider clothing. Jeans are standard clothing at Humber. Some people wear
    suits or dresses, which are more formal but still standard ways of
    dressing. Arriving topless to class might be perfectly functional if the
    classroom is warm, but it's not standard, and people will react to your
    choice of outfit. A snowsuit is also non-standard, as is a sari, a kimono,
    or a kilt. Some people on campus will react positively and some will react
    negatively. Many will suppress any outward reaction, but everyone will
    recognize that these ways of dressing are non-standard.
</p>
<p>
    That's kind of the way it is with non-Standard Englishes. It is a social
    standard, and it has social implications. Usually those are negative, and
    as language teachers we need to be intensely aware of what standards we are
    supporting and what effect that has on our students and on equity-seeking
    groups.

    <h2>Standard English(es)</h2>
</p>
<p>
George Eliot presents the following conversation in her novel
    <a
        href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Middlemarch.html?id=1v95iy6J0C0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"
        target="_blank"
    >
        <em>Middlemarch</em>
    </a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    "...All choice of words is slang. It marks a class."
    <br/>
    "There is correct English: that is not slang."
    <br/>
    "I beg your pardon: correct English is the slang of prigs who write history
    and essays. And the strongest slang of all is the slang of poets."
</p>
<p>
    She knew the difference between "correct English" and Standard English. But
    many people don't.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, there is no brief definition of Standard English. In fact,
    one goal of the first half of this course is to outline a partial
    definition of its syntax. But we can make a few remarks about its dominant status.
</p>
<p>
    To some degree any dialect is a standard, but most are not called "Standard
    English". If you try to sell a Standard gauge train to the TTC, you will
    not make a sale because that is not the Toronto standard. If you grew up
    speaking 
    <a 
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_English_in_Canada"
        target="blank"
    >
        First-Nations English
    </a>
    , then First-Nations English is likely the
    standard <strong>in your home community</strong>; anyone who goes to your
    community and speaks Standard English will be treated differently than
    those who speak First-Nations English because they are not using the
    standard in that community. <em>Differently</em> can mean better or worse or just differently.
    The special thing about speaking Standard English is that it would rarely
    occur to you that you might be discriminated against because of it.
</p>
<p>
    But let me reiterate that this is not because Standard is better, more
    formal, or even most common (though it is more common is particular communities). It is not synonymous with <em>grammatical</em> or
    <em>correct</em>. Nor does it imply truth, logic, beauty, purity or clarity. It is
    not how English <strong>ought</strong> to be spoken. It is just a cluster of dialects,
    albeit a powerful one, and a norm that is enforced by the dominant social
    group of English speakers. In much of the world, that means highly educated
    speakers of English from Britain and the British colonies where the Indigenous peoples
    were largely displaced by British colonists (e.g., Canada), and not those where the Indigenous 
    peoples were not (e.g., Bangladesh).

    <h2>Shibboleth </h2>
</p>
<p>
    There is a story about the gate-keeping function of dialects in Judges, the
    7th book of the Hebrew bible, which goes like this.
</p>
<p>
    Jephthah then called together the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim.
    The Gileadites struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, “You
    Gileadites are renegades from Ephraim and Manasseh.” The Gileadites
    captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a
    survivor of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead asked him,
    “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he replied, “No,” they said, “All right, say
    ‘Shibboleth.’” If he said, “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce the
    word correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan.
    Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time. –Judges 12:4
</p>
<p>
    From this story, we get the English word

    <h2>Grammaticality </g2>
</p>
<p>
    When I was first hired as an English teacher, it wasn't because of my
    qualifications. I had none. Nor was it because of my experience. As I said,
    it was my first teaching job. Nevertheless, I arrived in Japan in November
    of 1992, and within two weeks, I had been hired. I assume this was I
    because I am a "native speaker" of Standard English. Being white probably
    helped, too. Maybe even being male.
</p>
<p>
    As someone who grew up speaking English, I was obviously a competent user
    of the language, but I had little <strong>explicit</strong> grammatical
    knowledge. Most schools in Canada teach essentially nothing at all about
    English grammar. That was true in the 1970s and 80s, when I was in school,
    and it remains true today. I was lucky in that I was among the first wave
    of
    <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_immersion#Canada"
        target="_blank"
    >
        French immersion
    </a>
    students, and so I knew something about (French) grammar at least. But this
    was only the tiniest help to me when I tried to address my students'
    questions.
</p>
<p>
    "Why do you use the present continuous here, but the present simple there?"
"When do we need <em>the</em>?" "Why do we ask<em>who <u>does</u> she know </em>but not usually    <em>who <u>does</u> know her</em>?" To all of these questions, I could say
    little more than, "it sounds right." I had strong intuitions about what was
    grammatical and what was not, but I had no way of conveying those
    intuitions to my students in any systematic and generalizable way. I'd
    never even thought about what it means for something to be grammatical or
    not.
</p>
<p>
    At this point, you – yes, you – already have much more explicit knowledge
    of English grammar than I did. In fact, you probably have more explicit
    knowledge about English grammar than the average Humber professor. If a
student asked you about the determiners in    <em>I had coffee and a piece of toast for breakfast</em>, you can tell them
    that <em>coffee </em>is an non-count noun, so it doesn't require a
    determiner, but, as a singular count noun, <em>piece </em>can't go
    without. You know something about English grammar. So you're way ahead of
    where I was when I started out.
</p>
<p>
    But you still probably haven't thought about what it means for something to
    be grammatical. This is what I'd like to explore here. Before we dive in,
    though, just a few words about the fallacy of monosemy. If a word is
    monosemic, it has a single meaning. This is the idea at play when a child
    asks, "can I go to the toilet," and the teacher responds mockingly, "I
    don't know, <em>can </em>you?" The teacher acts as though <em>can </em>
    really has only one meaning, "ability", when in fact
    <a href="https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/can" target="_blank">
        <em>can </em>
        has multiple meanings
    </a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    We don't need to pretend that <em>grammatical </em>has only one true
    meaning, but clearly it doesn't mean just anything. How do we establish the
    meaning of <em>grammatical</em>? This comic explains (click for the full
    comic).

<p>
So, spend some time thinking about what <em>grammatical</em> and    <em>ungrammatical </em>mean to you.
</p>
<p>
    <iframe src="https://h5pstudio.ecampusontario.ca/h5p/4682/embed" width="1513" height="385" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="https://h5pstudio.ecampusontario.ca/modules/contrib/h5p/vendor/h5p/h5p-core/js/h5p-resizer.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</p>
<p>
    I would say that, if something is grammatical, it does not breach the
    appropriate syntactical and morphological constraints. But that just brings
    up new questions: what are those constraints and what does it mean to
    breach them? So, are we reduced to Wittegenstein's idea that language is
    use, that whatever we generally say is grammatical is grammatical? Well,
    yes, but that's of no help you or your students, so I would like to
    consider some examples.
</p>
<p>
    Let's start with an easy one.
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>
        <em>You key there me cookie</em>
        .
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    (1) seems unequivocally ungrammatical. But why? No, really, why? You feel
    that it is ungrammatical. You have that intuition, but if I claimed that
    this is actually grammatical, how would you prove me wrong?
</p>
<p>
    We could start with <em>cookie </em>and say that, as a singular, countable
noun, it needs a determiner and it doesn't seem to have one. An NP like    <em>my </em>could function as a determiner, but <em>me </em>doesn't
    function that way. You could look at <em>key </em>and ask yourself whether
    it's a noun or a verb. If it's a noun, then there is no verb, and if this
is supposed to be a clause, it needs a VP as its head. So, let's assume <em>key </em>is a verb. That makes <em>you </em>the subject. So, perhaps    <em>me </em>is an object:NP and <em>cookie </em>is another object, albeit
    an ungrammatical NP (missing a determiner). But then we need to consider
    the function of <em>there</em>. Presumably, it's a modifier in the VP
    (pronoun <em>me </em>cannot be modified by <em>there</em>). But a modifier
    in a VP can't typically come between the head and an object<em>. </em>And
    we can't find a match for the
    <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/key#Verb" target="_blank">
        meanings of the verb
    </a>
    <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/key#Verb" target="_blank">
        <em>key</em>
    </a>
    that work with two objects.<em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    But perhaps it's simpler than that. Maybe it's ungrammatical because it
    doesn't make sense. Could it be that grammatical language always makes
    sense? Could it be that something that makes sense is grammatical (these
    are not the same claims.) As critical thinkers, we need to try to disprove
    our ideas. We could do this by creating a grammatical utterance that makes
    no sense and comparing it to an ungrammatical utterance.
</p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
    <li>
        <em>Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Furiously ideas sleep green colorless.</em>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
   <img
        src="images/green-ideas.jpg"
        alt="A cartoon showing angry lightbulbs with green glows sleeping"

	/>
</p>

<p>
    Chomsky (1957 [2<sup>nd</sup> edition 2002]) claims that neither (2) nor
    (3), nor their subparts, would occur in a corpus of English, they would be
    “equally ‘remote’ from English” “in any statistical model of English” and
    that they are equally ungrammatical. But Pereirra (2000) showed that (2) is
    much more statistically likely than (3), which matches my intuition (and
    yours too, I assume). In fact, I would go so far as to say that (3) is
    nonsensical and ungrammatical but that event though (2) is nonsensical, it
    is grammatical. So I would say (2) disproves the idea that all grammatical
    language is meaningful. What do you think?
</p>
<p>
    Next, we'll consider the converse, that all meaningful language is
    grammatical. Before we do, try to think of something that is ungrammatical
    but has a clear meaning.
</p>
<p>
    Now consider (4).
</p>
<ol type="1" start="4">
    <li>
        <em>Jean Paul, very very good</em>
        .
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    This example was heard by my friend, Geoff Pullum, in an interview on NPR.
    As he explains in
    <a
        href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003830.html"
        target="_blank"
    >
        this blog post
    </a>
    , the woman was Turkish. Her meaning is clearly that Pope Jean Paul is a
    very, very good pope or perhaps a very, very good person. But for this to
    be grammatical in English, we need a clause, with a subject and a head.
That head should be a VP, which means we need a verb, presumably<em>be,</em> but <em>seem </em>or <em>become </em>would also be possible.    <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    It seems, then, that something can be grammatical but not meaningful and
    meaningful but not grammatical. Meaning, it seems doesn't have much to do
    with it.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps, then, we just go by the rules in grammar books.
</p>
<ol type="1" start="5">
    <li>
        <em>
            He was a beautiful young man, just a boy really, a beautiful
            beautiful boy.
        </em>
    </li>
    <li>
        *<em>The boy was beautiful beautiful. </em>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    As you can tell by the star, I think (6) is ungrammatical but (5) is
    grammatical. I assume you agree. The rule that explains this does appear in
    a grammar book, but not before 2002. But I also assume that you would agree
    that you've never read that rule, and the grammaticality of (5) and (6)
    didn't change in 2002. I guess we can set that idea aside then. Many rules
    are not mentioned in grammar books. In fact, many languages exist without
    any linguist having written a grammar for them.
</p>
<p>
    Now consider (7)
</p>
<ol type="1" start="7">
    <li>
        <em>*What movies do you have friends who acted in?</em>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    I think you'll agree that this is a very strange sentence, almost like an
    optical illusion, feeling grammatical and ungrammatical at the same time.
    The reason is thought to be the result of something called
    <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wh-movement#Extraction_islands"
        target="_blank"
    >
        island constraints
    </a>
    , which are thought to apply to all languages, though there is some debate
    about this. This could be something processing constraint in our brains, or
    it could be something about how information can be structured. Fortunately,
    if this is true, then you'll never have to explain it to your students,
    because nobody would try to use a sentence like this.
</p>
<p>
    So it seems that our processing ability may help us decide what is
    grammatical and what is not.
</p>
<p>
    Now consider which image matches (8).
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>
        <em>
            After the trip, my suitcase sat unpacked on the floor for days.
        </em>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
   <img
        src="images/suitcase1.png"
        alt="an open suitcase full of clothes"
        width="300"
        border="0"
	/>
	   <img
        src="images/suitcase2.png"
        alt="an open suitcase with no clothes"
        width="300"
        border="0"
	/>
</p>

<p>
    Many people say this is the first suitcase, but that is incorrect. The
    first suitcase is packed. The other one has been unpacked. It seems that
    our processing ability isn't all that great sometimes. So, maybe we can't
    even rely on instinct to judge what is grammatical.
</p>
<p>
    What about (9)?
</p>
<ol type="1" start="9">
    <li>
        <em>The horse raced past the barn fell.</em>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    I expect this seems ungrammatical to you, but you may have noticed that
    there is no star. What if we change <em>raced </em>to <em>ridden</em>? Now
    it is clearly grammatical (if it's net yet clear, it means "the horse that
    was raced past the barn fell"). The problem you had with (9) was that you
    interpreted <em>raced </em>as the past-tense form rather than that
    past-participle form. Again, maybe our instinct isn't 100% reliable.
    Sometimes, we need to think it through.
</p>
<ol type="1" start="10">
    <li>
        <em>I'll see you at the weekend.</em>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    This is ungrammatical in North American English but grammatical in UK
    English. As we discussed before, the reason is that we are operating under
    different cultural assumptions about the relevant metaphor for weekend
    (North Americans see it as a platform on which events play out, while
    people in the UK see it as a point at the end of the week.)
</p>
<ol type="1" start="11">
    <li>
        <em>I ain't no quitter. </em>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    This is another example of a dialectal difference. It's not grammatical in
    Standard English, but it is in other varieties. And it USED TO BE
    grammatical in Standard English, too.
</p>
<ol type="1" start="12">
    <li>
        <em>Me and Mia are taking the bus.</em>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    This is fully grammatical in all dialects, but it belongs to an informal
    register. The more formal version would use <em>Mia and I</em>. This is a
    shibboleth for some people.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
</p>
<p>
    Generally things that are grammatical are meaningful and vice versa, but
    not always. Many of the rules are described in grammar books, but many
    aren't, and often the description in grammars are incorrect. Expert users
    of English can generally rely on our intuition to know what is grammatical,
    but our intuition can be fooled. Sometimes, an explanation helps us to see
    something we didn't before. So, what makes grammatical grammatical?
</p>
<p>
    Just like soup, there is no single thing. There seems to be a combination
    of what is expected, what is meaningful, and what is processable, but none
    of these things has to be there.

    <h2>Normativity </h2>
</p>
<p>
    ”A normative statement is one that deals not with how things are but how
    they ought to be, or how it is appropriate for them to be given some set of
    values.”

Geoff Pullum makes <a href="https://paperhive.org/documents/items/LddAcg64jzyQ?a=p:217" target="blank">the following observations</a>:
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        “It is not polite to lick your knife” offers a reason for not licking
        your knife;
    </li>
    <li>
        “Torturing children is wrong” implies a reason for not torturing
        children;
    </li>
    <li>
        “Bach’s music is beautiful” suggests a reason for planning to attend a
        Bach concert;
    </li>
    <li>
        “Inflation is too low” signals to central bankers that they should
        lower interest rates;
    </li>
    <li>
        From “the fact that torturing a child is immoral,” it follows that we
        ought not to torture a child.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Are the rules of English grammar normative? If so, what do they tell us
    about how we ought to speak?
</p>
<p>
	Pullum observes
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
Since nobody is under any obligation to speak English,        <strong>in general</strong>, <strong>nothing at all</strong> follows
        concerning what anyone ought to do or not do.
    </li>
    <li>
        But
        <strong>
            if we want to be taken to be speaking a particular variety of
            English</strong>, then we ought to follow the rules of that variety.
    </li>
    <li>
        On the other hand,
        <strong>
            if we merely want to communicate with an English speaker</strong>, then what we ought to do is less clear.
    </li>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>
            Perhaps, we ought to aim to be comprehensible or to be able to
            comprehend. Grammatical accuracy does not guarantee
            comprehensibility, but there is a positive correlation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Similarly, perhaps, we ought to be timely and fluent, but concern
            about being grammatical may reduce timeliness and fluency.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
    <h2>Audience</h2>
</p>
<p>
    One last point about normativity is that it often presumes a population in
    which the norm applies. Before, we we said that grammaticality is a
    combination of meaning, expectedness and processability, we're missing part
    of the picture, or at least we're taking it for granted. That is the
    audience. When we say something is meaningful, we mean it is meaningful to
    somebody. When we say something is expected, it is expected by somebody.
    That somebody is a key piece here, and generally that somebody is the
    social group of Standard English speakers.
</p>
<p>
    To the extent that our students wish to gain access to the social group of
    SE speakers, it's clear that we should facilitate that. But the
    facilitation goes two ways. The standard way is to put the burden on
    students to conform. That's how most English teachers see our jobs. Of
    course, there is value in teaching them about SE and giving students the
    tools that would allow them access to the social group of SE speakers,
    should they wish or need to join. But there is another way, and that is to
    help SE speakers to accommodate, include, accept, and welcome users of
    other varieties of English. Needless to say, we do much less of this (or,
    perhaps, almost none at all). But as English-language teachers, we should
    consider how we may go about promoting such attitudes.
