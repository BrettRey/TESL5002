		<h1>Adjectives and adjective phrases</h1>
		<p>You've made it through the two main lexical categories, nouns and verbs. Now it's time to look at adjectives.
		<p>Before we start, I think it's useful to restate that these characteristics are often related to teaching points. For example, the issue of nouns being countable is actually an issue that causes a great deal of confusion for students.
		<p>So, with that said...
		<oL>
			<li>Adjective typically denote properties or characteristics, but not objects or actions.</li>
			<li>Adjectives always head an adjective phrase.</li>
			<li>Adjective phrases modify nouns and adjectives, but not verbs.</li>
			<li>Any phrase that can function as complement to <i>be</i>, <i>become</i>, and <i>seem</i> is an adjective phrase.</li>
			<li>Any word that can be modified by <i>very</i>, <i>too</i>, and <i>so</i> is an adjective (or an adverb).</li>
			<li>Many adjectives can take <i>-er</i> and <i>-est</i> endings, but so can many adverbs.</li>
			<li>Many adjectives can be gradable with <i>less</i> and <i>least</i>, so can many adverbs.</li>
			<li>Many adjectives can take an <i>-ly</i> ending and become an adverbs.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Here are some examples.

				question="If you have a NP like <i>the frible paper</i>, how could you easily distinguish whether <i>frible</i> is a noun or an adjective? (<i>frible</i> is not a real word)"
				answer="If <i>frible</i> is modifiable by an adjective (e.g., <i>the civil frible paper</i>), its a noun; if it's modifiable by an adverb (e.g., <i>the relatively frible paper</i>), it's an adjective."
