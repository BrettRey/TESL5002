		<p style="padding-left:30px;"><img src="images/allcategories.png" alt="a diagram showing all the lexical categories and their phrasal projections" width="450"> 
		<p style="padding-left:30px;">We've now looked at Noun, Verb, Determinative, Adjective, Preposition, Adverb and their phrasal projections. <br>We haven’t looked at Interjections, Subordinators, Coordinators, or Coordinations.

	<h1>Functions</h1>
	<p style="padding-left:30px;">Here’s a hierarchy of syntactic functions:
		<p style="padding-left:30px;"><img src="images/functions.png" alt="a diagram showing all the syntactic funcions" width="450"> 
	<p style="padding-left:30px;">As you can see, Heads are special: everything else depends on them. As a result, everything else is a dependent. So far, we’ve seen four main kinds of dependent.
	<h2>Subjects</h2><ul>
	<li>A subject is a dependent in a clause</li>
<li>The subject typically occurs before the head verb.</li>
<li>In certain kinds of questions, the subject occurs after an auxiliary verb.</li>

<li>The subject is usually the topic of the sentence.</li>
<li>If there is an action, it’s usually the person or thing doing the action.</li>
<li>If there is a present-tense verb, it typically agrees with the subject.</li>
<li>The subject is usually an NP, but Subj:Clause is also common, and Subj:PP is possible.</li></ul>
<hr>
<h2>Determiners</h2><ul>
<li>A determiner is only and always a kind of dependent in an NP.</li>
<li>An NP will never have more than one determiner (though other NPs inside the NP may have their own determiners).</li>
<li>Determiners are (almost) always determinatives or possessive NPs.</li>
<li>A singular countable noun needs a determiner to form an NP.</li>
<li>Determiners typically come before modifiers in the NP.</li></ul>
<hr>
<h2>Complements</h2><ul>
<li>Complements are so named because they often "complete" a phrase.</li>
<li>Almost any kind of phrase can be a complement, though AdvPs complements are rare.</li>
<li>Complements usually follow their head. In contrast, modifiers can often move around (e.g., the modifier quickly can go at the beginning, middle, and end of she changed direction).</li>
<li>Complements are "selected" by their head (e.g., <i>listen <b>to</b> the music</i> not *<i>listen <b>about</b> the music</i>) .</li>
<li>Phrases about where or when the situation happens or holds are typically modifiers, not complements.</li>
<li>A modifier usually will not occur between a head and a complement.</li>
<li>There can be zero, one, or two complements. A very small number of verbs take three complements (e.g., I bet you $100 that you will be a good teacher).</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the boundary between complements and modifiers can be very fuzzy.</li></ul>
<h3>Objects</h3>
	<li>Objects are a special kind of complement.</li><ul>
<li>Objects are dependents only in VPs or PPs.</li>
<li>Objects are almost always NPs.</li>
<li>If there’s an action, the object is usually what is acted on.</li>
<li>The object of an active sentence is usually the subject of the related passive sentence (e.g., <i>I made <u>the cake</u></i> -->  <i><u>the cake</u> was made</i>).</li></ul>
<hr>
<h2>Modifiers</h2><ul>
<li>Modifiers appear in most kinds of phrases.</li>
<li>Typical modifiers are AdjPs and AdvPs, but almost any phrase can function as a modifier.</li>
<li>Modifiers are quite flexible.</li>
<li>Modifiers can often be removed without significant change of meaning.</li>
<li>Modifiers can almost always be added or removed without affecting grammaticality.</li>
<li>The number of modifiers is typically unlimited.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the boundary between complements and modifiers can be very fuzzy.</li></ul>
